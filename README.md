# Cap-O-Meter

Build with Arduino, Cap-O-Meter counts cups from plastic bottles for you! In Greece, it's very common for schools to collect plastic bottle caps, in order to recycle them and get a wheelchair for someone disabled. With this device, there is no need for a teacher to count them manually! Cap-O-Meter counts each cup thrown in it!
